# Overview

I built a Tic-Tac-Toe game using React and TypeScript.

My Goal in doing this was to learn about the basics of React and Type Script

# Web Pages

This project involves a single web page. It has a tic-tac-toe board with a status label above it 
informing the user who's turn it is and a message box below the board to tell a user why a move wasn't able to be complied.

# Development Environment

I used React and TypeScript to compte this following a guide i generated with ChapGPT who also provided
expiations of what parts of the program did 

# Future Work

I have no plans to continue updating this. Tic-tac-toe is extremely simple and this simple site implements it completely. Though I do plan to keep on the look out for places i can use TypeScript and React.

I find TypeScript much more present than JavaScript and I am fascinated by the possibilities React brings up, it seems like its based around designing dynamic web pages which are infinitely more interesting to me than static web pages.
